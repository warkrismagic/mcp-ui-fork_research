# About

`mcp-ui` brings interactive web components to the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP), allowing developers to deliver rich, dynamic UI resources directly from their MCP server to be rendered on the client. The project provides a collection of server and client SDKs that make it easy to define reusable UI snippets, render them securely, and handle user interactions within an MCP host environment.

`mcp-ui` is a project by [Ido Salomon](https://x.com/idosal1), in collaboration with [Liad Yosef](https://x.com/liadyosef).
