## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Set up the development environment.
3. Explore the codebase, run tests, and verify that everything works as expected.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

Before you start working on MCP-UI, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (version 8.15.7 or higher)
- Git

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Clone your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp-ui.git
   cd mcp-ui
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
   - Add any necessary environment variables (ask project maintainers if you need access to specific API keys)

### Running the Project Locally

To start the development server:

```bash
pnpm vercel dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server, typically at http://localhost:3000.

For running with the MCP Inspector (useful for debugging MCP endpoints):

```bash
pnpm run inspector
```

### Testing

To run tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

MCP-UI uses Vitest as the testing framework. When adding new features, please include appropriate tests.

### Code Formatting

MCP-UI uses Prettier for code formatting and lint-staged to ensure code is properly formatted before committing. Pre-commit hooks are set up with Husky to run these checks automatically.

To manually format your code:

```bash
pnpm prettier --write .
```

### Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature/bugfix
2. Make your changes
3. Add tests for your changes when applicable
4. Run the tests to ensure they pass
5. Commit your changes following the commit message guidelines
6. Push your branch and open a pull request

### Project Structure

- `api/`: Contains the server-side code and MCP implementation
  - `tools/`: MCP tools implementation
  - `utils/`: Utility functions for the API
- `app/`: Next.js app directory with React components
- `pages/`: Additional Next.js pages
- `public/`: Static assets
- `shared/`: Shared utilities used across the codebase

## How to Contribute

## Style Guidelines

### Code Style

MCP-UI uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) as its code style guide. Please ensure that your code follows these guidelines.
